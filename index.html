Hiya! I'm Jung Choi, and I'm a first year at RIT studying Software Engineering
</p>
<p style="color:yellow">
I went to Troy High School as part of the Troy Tech program
<br>
I hope to do software engineering as a career, but to keep myself busy I like to make music on the side, usually EDM or whatever's on my mind at the moment
<br>
I like to try new things and meet new people
<br>
This website is not pretty because I tried to make it ugly
<br>

Here is a picture of my favorite food (beverage?):

<br>Here's a link to the <a href="https://www.rit.edu/computing/department-software-engineering">RIT SE website</a>

<br>
<br>
A few things I want to learn from the course:
<ul style="color:blue">
  <li>Software development workflows and how to apply them</li>
  <li>Ways to coordinate a team to work on large projects</li>
  <li>Common frameworks, how they're used, and when they're useful</li>
  <li>Different types of specialties in software dev and when they're useful</li>
</ul>
</p>
